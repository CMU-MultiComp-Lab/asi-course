title: Examples of Previous Project Reports
description: Project reports from student teams who participated in previous editions of the ASI course

We list here only project reports that were publicly released by students. It should be noted that some of these links are for the follow-up submissions to conferences, after some revisions of the original project reports.

If you previously took the ASI course and ended up releasing a public version of your project report, we would love to hear about it! Please contact the course instructor to be added to this list.
