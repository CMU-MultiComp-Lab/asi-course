    Week 2: <strong>Social intelligence</strong> <a href="11866_week2.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - How would you define social intelligence? What aspects of the proposed definitions most resonated with you? Will these definitions of social intelligence generalize to artificial social intelligence?
    - Should we always try to separate social intelligence from other types of intelligence, more specifically abstract intelligence (often referred to as g-factor or general intelligence)? What are the similarities and differences?
    - Given the ups and downs of social intelligence research, what method(s) would you support to measure social intelligence (e.g., self-reports, behavioral measures,...)? Will these measures generalize to a setup involving artificial social intelligence?
    - What are the main components (aka, sub-constructs) of social intelligence? In other words, can we separate the concept of social intelligence into separate factors, separate sub-concepts? What are these components (aka, sub-constructs, sub-concepts)? Can you start drafting a taxonomy of social intelligence sub-concepts?
    - How are the methods used in psychometric testing (as mentioned on the reading papers) could be applied to our recent methods used in AI, mostly based on deep learning approaches? Are these compatible? How can we handle this uncertainty both in defining and measuring social intelligence?

    Week 3: <strong>Social skills and competence</strong> <a href="11866_week3.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - How would define the concepts of social skills and social competency? How does social intelligence relate to these concepts (social skills and competency)? What aspects of the proposed definitions most resonated with you? Will these definitions of social intelligence generalize to artificial social intelligence? 
    - Would it be best to study “artificial social skills and competency”, instead of “artificial social intelligence”? Do you see both concepts working together? What are the main differences? Which one should we prioritize?
    - Can someone create a list of all social skills? What would this taxonomy look like and how can we validate it? Will the same taxonomy of social skills also apply to artificial social intelligence technologies?
    - Social skills and competency are often discussed in relationship with human personality traits. Should we think of social skills as long-term traits, or more shorter-term? More contextualized? Are they learned or innate?
    - Start thinking on how we can build a framework that integrates social intelligence, social skills and social competency? How to evaluate such a framework? How to study this very large problem of artificial social intelligence in a systematic way, over many years?  What would be your proposed research agenda?

    Week 4: <strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> <a href="11866_week4.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - Are emotions the same as emotional intelligence? How would you define emotions? How would define emotional intelligence? How do you relate these two concepts of emotions and emotional intelligence? Do we want AI systems to have emotions, emotional intelligence or both?
    - What would be the equivalent of this emotions vs emotional intelligence comparison when talking about social intelligence? Should we compare social intelligence to social interactions? Social behaviors? Or social skills?
    - Should we use the term emotional intelligence or emotional competence? Should we talk about emotional skills, in a similar way to our discussion about social skills? 
    - Is it important to differentiate social intelligence from emotional intelligence? Similarly, should we differentiate social skills from emotional skills? Social competence vs emotional competence? Or should we integrate them? Or the union of all these concepts?
    - Can you identify examples and use cases where clearly a situation is referring to emotional intelligence and not social intelligence? Or vice-versa? 
    - What are the skills and/or abilities would you expect an AI system to have so that we can call it emotionally intelligent? Is there a core set of skills/abilities that are particularly important? We could call them the “core skills/abilities”. What would be the core set of abilities and skills for social intelligence? Social competence?

    Week 5: <strong>Artificial social agents- Measurements</strong>
  topics:
    - With a view towards artificial social agents (robots, virtual humans,...), how should we measure the quality of social intelligence, social competence and social skills? Should we apply the measures from human social intelligence directly to artificial social intelligence? Where are the main differences?
    - Researchers in robotics, virtual humans and artificial intelligence started building questionnaires and benchmarks to measure social intelligence. How could we improve these proposed questionnaires and benchmarks, possibly using the knowledge gained from studying human social intelligence, competence, and skills?
    - The Tian & Oviatt paper studies socio-emotional competence with a slightly different perspective, looking instead to the errors happening during human-robot interactions? Should we focus more on the errors or on the competence? How are these two concepts related? Does competence mean lack of errors? Should we try to bring competence and errors in the same framework?
    - Many of the questionnaires for social robots and virtual humans are based on direct interaction with the AI system. After the interaction, the human subject is asked to fill the questionnaire to evaluate and measure social intelligence. This is in contrast with a more “offline” approach, such as Social IQA, where scenarios are written and shared with the AI system directly, to evaluate its social intelligence. Which approach should we prioritize? What are the pros and cons of both paradigms (evaluation after direct interaction vs simulated written scenarios)?
    - What are the other evaluation paradigms you think would be helpful to measure social intelligence of artificial social agents?
    - Do you expect social intelligence to be measured differently between an physically-embodied AI (e.g., robot) or a virtually-embodied AI (e.g., virtual human)? What about non-embodied agents or agents with different embodiment (e.g., HAL 9000)? How should we measure social intelligence?

    Week 6: <strong>Social cognition and social interactions</strong>
  topics:
    - How would you relate the theories from social cognition research with the concepts previously discussed in this course, including social intelligence, social skills and social competence? Can you draft an updated taxonomy (or theoretical framework) which integrates all these concepts? What are the differences between these different views?
    - “Theory of Mind” is a term that evolved over the decades, and has become popular in recent years for researchers in robotics and AI, when discussing how technologies should interact with humans. From your readings, what is missing from Theory of Mind to have a complete artificial social intelligence?
    - When reflecting on how to build artificial social agents, it is helpful to think about what are the core abilities and skills needed for AI to successfully participate in social interactions. Based on your readings and insights, what are the core elements of social interactions for artificial social agents? Lightart et al. 2021 suggests an initial list. What core elements are missing? Which elements are definitely key to social interactions?
    - Some researchers argue that social cognition research should include social interactions (aka interactionism theory). From your perspective, how much of social intelligence can be assessed offline, using tests such as the ones often used for Theory of Mind assessment? How much of social intelligence is also interactional (online) and requires different assessment methods?
    - Social perception is also an important aspect of social intelligence. The Brunswik’s Lens model is a landmark model for studying human interpersonal communication. Since signals are likely to be interpreted differently, from different people, how can we model all these different perspectives of the same social interaction?
